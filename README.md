# CRUD Playground Project

ðŸ¤— This is a personal project where I practice CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) concepts by implementing functionality for managing Posts and reading/downloading photos.

## Features

- **Create:** Add new post with title and body.
- **Read:** View the list of existing posts and read their details.
- **Update:** Modify the content of existing posts.
- **Delete:** Remove posts from the collection.

Additionally, the project includes functionality to read and download photos to the device.

## UI Design Inspiration

The UI design of this project is inspired by the work on Dribbble by [K&Z Design]. Design inspiration can be found here: [Toio - The Simplest Todo App Ever](https://dribbble.com/shots/20533818-Toio-the-simplest-todo-app-ever).
